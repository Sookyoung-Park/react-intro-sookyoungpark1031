### **Componenet**
A component is a logical unit that packages up some functionality or some part of the display that can potentially be reused. React is basically just a tree of components

- **Main App**: the top level component, it only has custom child components in it, not html components.

- **Search Bar**: this is the search bar at the top

- **Video Detail**: the highlight larger video display

- **Video List**: the list of videos found

- **Video List Item**: an item in the list of videos



### What Worked Well
    Overall followed the short assignment material well.

### What Didn't
     It was bit tricky to fix the previous environmnet setting. Also some lines are bit confusing where to add on.
